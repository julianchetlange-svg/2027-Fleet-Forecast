# McCoy's Fleet Forecast 2027

Company-wide 2027 fleet cost forecast for Regions 01–08, Distribution, Millwork and Headquarters (every active asset except 950 Rio Truss), with a scenario tool to move, terminate or relocate assets.

Open `index.html` (or the GitHub Pages site). Scenario changes are kept in the viewer's browser only; use **Export to Excel** to save a scenario and **Import scenario** to load it back.

## Cost rules
- **Stores (Regions 01–08):** fuel + flat rate + $0.425 per truck mile.
- **Actual cost (Distribution, Millwork, Headquarters, 355CD, 355 Reload, regional loaner pools):** fuel + maintenance + depreciation + lease + registration, taxes, Geotab and Lytx.
- Two views: location charges (rules above) and operating cost (actual spend for every asset).

## Files
- `index.html`: the built dashboard.
- `data/data.json`: asset-level model inputs.
- `src/build_company.py`: builds `data.json` from the source exports (not in this repo).
- `src/head.html`, `src/body.html`: dashboard source; `src/build_html.py` assembles `index.html`.

Method and data flags are on the dashboard's **Assumptions & data** tab.
